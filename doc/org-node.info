On _[2024-09-02 Mon]_, the git repo history was REWRITTEN!  You may have
had to delete and reinstall the package.  (Depends on your package
manager.)  Sorry about that.

   *What was rewritten?*  I've erased the ‘;; Package-Version:’ comment
line in file contents, because of Emacs 30's new ‘(use-package :vc)’
keyword, which defaults to installing the _oldest_ commit with a given
Package-Version, not the _newest_ commit.

   Even if that's 5 years old.

   See some loooong related discussions
(https://github.com/melpa/melpa/issues/2955#issuecomment-1519154736)
about the untrustworthiness of Package-Version, and that's leaving aside
the fact the ecosystem doesn't really make use of the concept of
versioned releases (https://github.com/melpa/melpa/issues/6656), and
when some tools pretend it does instead of taking the newest commit,
they make it less stable for all
(https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/1f8ok7c/do_you_set_packageinstallupgradebuiltin_to_t/llimwe0/).

   Lesson learned - when _you_ create a package, never commit a file
containing a Package-Version line.  Doing so curses the repo for the
rest of time, or until you use git-filter-repo to undo the damage.

2.1 What's all this
===================

I found org-roam too slow, so I made quickroam
(https://github.com/meedstrom/quickroam).  And that idea spun off into
this package, a standalone thing.  I hope it's also easier to pick up
than org-roam.

   • *If you were using org-roam*, there is nothing to migrate.  You can
     use both packages.  It's exactly the same on-disk format: "notes"
     are identified by their org-id.

     With optional shims, you can even *skip syncing the org-roam DB*
     and continue using its rich backlinks buffer and org-roam-capture!

     In pursuit of being "just org-id", this package has no equivalent
     setting to ‘org-roam-directory’ - it just looks up
     ‘org-id-locations’.

   • *If you were not using org-roam*, maybe think of it as somewhat
     like org-recent-headings
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-recent-headings) beefed-up to the
     extent that you won't need other methods of browsing.

     If you were the sort of person to prefer ID-links over file links
     or any other type of link, you're in the right place!  Now you can
     rely on IDs, and--if you want--stop worrying about filenames,
     directories and subtree hierarchies.  As long as you've assigned an
     ID to a heading, you can find it later.

2.2 What's a "node"?
====================

My life can be divided into two periods "*before org-roam*" and "*after
org-roam*".  I crossed a kind of gap once I got a good way to link
between my notes.  It's odd to remember when I just relied on browsing
subtrees and folders - what a strange way to work!

   I used to lose track of things I had written, under some forgotten
heading in a forgotten file in a forgotten directory.  The org-roam
method let me *find* and *build on* my own work, instead of recreating
my work all the time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptomnesia).

   At the core, all the "notetaking packages" (orgrr
(https://github.com/rtrppl/orgrr)/zk
(https://github.com/localauthor/zk)/zetteldeft
(https://github.com/EFLS/zetteldeft)/org-roam
(https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam)/denote
(https://github.com/protesilaos/denote)/howm
(https://github.com/kaorahi/howm)/minaduki
(https://github.com/kisaragi-hiu/minaduki)/...) try to help you with
this: make it easy to link between notes and explore them.

   Right off the bat, that imposes two requirements: a method to search
for notes, since you can't link to something you can't search for, and a
design-choice about what kinds of things should turn up as search hits.
What's a "note"?

   Just searching for Org files is too coarse.  Just searching for any
subtree anywhere brings in too much clutter.

   *Here's what org-roam invented.*  It turns out that if you limit the
search-hits to just those files and subtrees you've deigned to assign an
org-id - which roughly maps to _everything you've ever thought it was
worth linking to_ - it filters out the noise excellently.

   Once a subtree has an ID you can link to, it's a "node" because it
has joined the wider graph, the network of linked nodes.  I wish the
English language had more distinct sounds for the words "node" and
"note", but to clarify, I'll say "ID-node" when the distinction matters.

File: org-node.info,  Node: Install,  Next: Quick start,  Up: Setup

3.1 Install
===========

Assuming your package manager knows about MELPA
(https://melpa.org/#/getting-started), add this initfile snippet:

     (use-package org-node
       :after org
       :config (org-node-cache-mode))

   It's a very recent addition to MELPA, so you may have to refresh the
recipe list first:

     M-x package-refresh-contents RET

   On Elpaca:

     C-u M-x elpaca-update-menus RET

   On Straight (I think):

     M-x straight-fetch-all RET

   If you are an org-roam user, you'll want the org-node-fakeroam
(https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node-fakeroam) module as well.  It is
not on MELPA yet, so use straight.el
(https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el) or similar and add an
init snippet like this:

     (use-package org-node-fakeroam
       :straight (org-node-fakeroam
                  :type git :host github :repo "meedstrom/org-node-fakeroam"
                  :branch "melpa")
       :defer)


File: org-node.info,  Node: Quick start,  Next: Use Org-roam at the same time?,  Prev: Install,  Up: Setup

3.2 Quick start
===============

If you're new to these concepts, fear not.  The main things for
day-to-day operation are two verbs: "find" and "link".

   Pick some short keys and try them out.

     (keymap-set global-map "M-s M-f" #'org-node-find)
     (keymap-set org-mode-map "M-s M-i" #'org-node-insert-link)

   To browse config options, type ‘M-x customize-group RET org-node
RET’.

   Final tip: there's *no separate command* for creating a new node!
Reuse one of the commands above, then type the name of a node that
doesn't exist.  Try it and see what happens!


File: org-node.info,  Node: Use Org-roam at the same time?,  Prev: Quick start,  Up: Setup

3.3 Use Org-roam at the same time?
==================================

These settings help you feel at home using both packages side-by-side:

     (setq org-node-creation-fn #'org-node-new-via-roam-capture)
     (setq org-node-slug-fn #'org-node-slugify-like-roam-actual)
     (setq org-node-datestamp-format "%Y%m%d%H%M%S-")

   If you've struggled in the past with big files taking a long time to
save, consider these org-roam settings:

     (setq org-roam-db-update-on-save nil) ;; don't update DB on save, not needed
     (setq org-roam-link-auto-replace nil) ;; don't look for "roam:" links on save

   And if the backlinks buffer has been laggy:

     (org-node-fakeroam-fast-render-mode) ;; build the Roam buffer faster

   Finally, make sure the underlying org-id knows about the files
org-roam knows about.  You'd think it would, but that isn't a given!  Do
either of these:

  1. Run ‘M-x org-roam-update-org-id-locations’ every now and then

  2. Edit the following setting so it includes your
     ‘org-roam-directory’.  Supposing that is "~/org/", set this:

     (setq org-node-extra-id-dirs '("~/org/"))

   With that done, try out the commands we went over in Quick start
(https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node#quick-start).  There's more under
Toolbox (https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node#toolbox).  Enjoy!

4.1 What are backlinks?
=======================

Backlinks are the butter on the bread of your notes.  If you've ever
seen a "What links here" section on some webpage, that's exactly what it
is.  Imagine seeing that, all the time.  The following sections outline
two general ways to do so.

4.2 Backlink solution 1: Borrow org-roam's backlink buffer
==========================================================

As a Roam user, you can just keep using ‘M-x org-roam-buffer-toggle’,
but you get some new ways to keep its data fresh, circumventing Roam's
autosync mode.

4.2.1 Option 1A: Let org-roam manage its own DB
-----------------------------------------------

If you didn't have laggy saves, this is fine.  In other words, keep
variable ‘org-roam-db-update-on-save’ at t.


File: org-node.info,  Node: Option 1B Tell org-node to write to the org-roam DB,  Next: Option 1C Cut out the DB altogether,  Prev: Option 1A Let org-roam manage its own DB,  Up: Backlink solution 1 Borrow org-roam's backlink buffer

4.2.2 Option 1B: Tell org-node to write to the org-roam DB
----------------------------------------------------------

Add this init snippet:

     (setq org-roam-db-update-on-save nil)
     (org-node-fakeroam-db-feed-mode)

   Unfortunately, it is still a bit slow when I save a file with 400
nodes.  It appears to be all down to EmacSQL - if someone could help
optimize how we call EmacSQL, that'd be much appreciated.  Until then, I
recommend Option 1C.

   Related: if you often have reason to full-reset the DB, there is a
faster command than ‘C-u M-x org-roam-db-sync’!  Try ‘M-x
org-node-fakeroam-db-rebuild’.  Benchmark on my device:

   • ‘C-u M-x org-roam-db-sync’: 179 seconds
   • ‘M-x org-node-fakeroam-db-rebuild’: 6 seconds

   This is also a place where I request help, since 6 seconds seems a
lot slower than it needs to be.  I envision running it on every save -
that's obviously not possible yet.

4.2.3 Option 1C: Cut out the DB altogether
------------------------------------------

No more battling SQLite!  Type ‘M-x
org-node-fakeroam-jit-backlinks-mode’, then see what populates your Roam
buffer henceforth.  Hopefully you see the same links as before.

   If you're happy with the result, you can disable
‘org-roam-db-autosync-mode’ entirely.  Its remaining functionality can
be reproduced by ‘M-x org-node-fakeroam-redisplay-mode’.  As an init
snippet:

     (org-roam-db-autosync-mode 0)
     (org-node-fakeroam-jit-backlinks-mode) ;; no use roam db to build buffer
     (org-node-fakeroam-fast-render-mode) ;; build the buffer fast
     (org-node-fakeroam-redisplay-mode) ;; always show local backlinks

4.3 Backlink solution 2: Print inside the file
==============================================

I rarely have the screen space to display a backlink buffer.  Because it
needs my active involvement to keep visible, I go long periods seeing no
backlinks.  This solution can be a great complement (or even stand
alone).

4.3.1 Option 2A: Let org-node manage a ‘:BACKLINKS:’ property
-------------------------------------------------------------

For a first-time run, type ‘M-x org-node-backlink-fix-all’.  (Don't
worry, if you change your mind, you can undo with ‘M-x
org-node-backlink-regret’.)

   Then start using the minor mode ‘org-node-backlink-mode’, which keeps
these properties updated.  Init snippet:

     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-node-backlink-mode)

   NOTE: I hadn't even realized this, but people who _don't_ use
visual-line-mode may not find this solution very scalable, since Org
properties must stay on one line.  This marks the second time I
distribute software that assumes visual-line-mode :-)

I _think_ the following should work.  Totally untested, let me know!

   Bad news: this is currently directed towards people who used
org-super-links (https://github.com/toshism/org-super-links) from the
beginning, or people who are just now starting to assign IDs, as there
is not yet a command to add new BACKLINKS drawers in bulk to preexisting
nodes.  (org-super-links#93

5.1 Org-capture
===============

You may have heard that org-roam has its own special set of capture
templates: the ‘org-roam-capture-templates’.

   People who understand the magic of capture templates, they may take
this in stride.  Me, I never felt confident using a second-order
abstraction over an already leaky abstraction I didn't fully understand.

   Can we just use vanilla org-capture?  That'd be less scary.  The
answer is yes!

   The secret sauce is ‘(function org-node-capture-target)’:

     (setq org-capture-templates
           '(("i" "Capture into ID node"
              plain (function org-node-capture-target) nil
              :empty-lines-after 1)

             ("j" "Jump to ID node"
              plain (function org-node-capture-target) nil
              :jump-to-captured t
              :immediate-finish t)

             ;; Sometimes handy after `org-node-insert-link' to
             ;; make a stub you plan to fill in later
             ("q" "Make quick stub ID node"
              plain (function org-node-capture-target) nil
              :immediate-finish t)))

   With that done, you can optionally configure the everyday commands
‘org-node-find’ & ‘org-node-insert-link’ to outsource to org-capture
when they try to create new nodes:

     (setq org-node-creation-fn #'org-capture)


File: org-node.info,  Node: Node series,  Next: Managing org-id-locations,  Prev: Org-capture,  Up: Misc

5.2 Node series
===============

Do you already know about "daily-notes"?  Then get started with a
keybinding such as:

     (keymap-set global-map "M-s s" #'org-node-series-dispatch)

   and configure ‘org-node-series-defs’ if needed.  See wiki
(https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node/wiki/Configuring-series).

* Menu:

* What are series?::


File: org-node.info,  Node: What are series?,  Up: Node series

5.2.1 What are series?
----------------------

It's easiest to explain series if we use "daily-notes" (or "dailies") as
an example of a series.

   Roam's idea of a "daily-note" is the same as an org-journal
(https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal) entry: a file/entry where the
title is just today's date.

   You don't need software for that basic idea, only to make it extra
convenient to navigate them and jump back and forth in the series.

   Thus, fundamentally, any "journal" or "dailies" software are just
operating on a sorted series to navigate through.  I was resisting
having to implement an equivalent to the Org-roam option
‘org-roam-dailies-directory’, so I ended up generalizing the concept and
it's really powerful!

   You could have series about, let's say, historical events, Star Trek
episodes, your school curriculum...

   Define more series in the variable ‘org-node-series-defs’.

   Already included is a definition that approximates the
org-roam-dailies defaults, but I encourage you to override it to suit
your tastes.

   You may be taken aback that defining a new series requires writing 5
lambdas, but once you get the hang of it, you can often reuse those
lambdas.

5.3 Managing org-id-locations
=============================

I find unsatisfactory the config options in org-id (Why?  See Taking
ownership of org-id
(http://edstrom.dev/wjwrl/taking-ownership-of-org-id)), so org-node
gives you an extra way to feed data to org-id, making sure we won't run
into "ID not found" situations.

   Example setting:

     (setq org-node-extra-id-dirs
           '("/home/kept/org/"
             "~/Syncthing/project2/"
             "/mnt/stuff/"))

5.4 Completion-at-point
=======================

To complete words at point into known node titles:

     (org-node-complete-at-point-mode)
     (setq org-roam-completion-everywhere nil) ;; Prevent Roam's variant

5.5 Let org-open-at-point detect refs
=====================================

Say there's a link to a web URL, and you've forgotten you also have a
node listing that exact URL in its ‘ROAM_REFS’ property.

   Wouldn't it be nice if, clicking on that link, you automatically
visit that node first instead of being sent to the web?  Here you go:

     (add-hook 'org-open-at-point-functions
               #'org-node-try-visit-ref-node)


File: org-node.info,  Node: Limitation TRAMP,  Next: Limitation Unique titles,  Prev: Let org-open-at-point detect refs,  Up: Misc

5.6 Limitation: TRAMP
=====================

Working over TRAMP is untested, but I suspect it won't work.  Org-node
tries to be very fast, often nulling ‘file-name-handler-alist’, which
TRAMP needs.

   The best way to change this is to file an issue
(https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node/issues) to show you care :-)


File: org-node.info,  Node: Limitation Unique titles,  Next: Limitation Excluding notes,  Prev: Limitation TRAMP,  Up: Misc

5.7 Limitation: Unique titles
=============================

If two ID-nodes exist with the same title, one of them disappears from
minibuffer completions.

   That's just the nature of completion.  Other packages such as Roam
have the same limitation.  Much can be said for embracing the uniqueness
constraint, and org-node will print messages telling you about title
collisions.

   Anyway... there's a workaround.  Assuming you leave
‘org-node-affixation-fn’ at its default setting, just add to initfiles:

     (setq org-node-alter-candidates t)

   This lets you match against the node outline path and not only the
title, which resolves most conflicts given that the most likely source
of conflict is subheadings in disparate files, that happen to be named
the same.  Some people
(https://fosstodon.org/@nickanderson/112249581810196258) make this trick
part of their workflow.

   NB: this workaround won't help the in-buffer completions provided by
‘org-node-complete-at-point-mode’, but with a light peppering of luck
this isn't something you'll ever have to notice.


File: org-node.info,  Node: Limitation Excluding notes,  Next: Limitation Org-ref,  Prev: Limitation Unique titles,  Up: Misc

5.8 Limitation: Excluding notes
===============================

The option ‘org-node-filter-fn’ works well for excluding TODO items that
happen to have an ID, and excluding org-drill items and that sort of
thing, but beyond that, it has limited utility because unlike org-roam,
*child ID nodes of an excluded node are not excluded!*

   So let's say you have a big archive file, fulla IDs, and you want to
exclude all of them from appearing in the minibuffer.  Putting a
‘:ROAM_EXCLUDE: t’ at the top won't do it.  As it stands, what I'd
suggest is to use the file name.

   While a big selling point of IDs is that you avoid depending on
filenames, it's often pragmatic to let up on purism just a bit :-) It
works well for me to filter out any file or directory that happens to
contain "archive" in the name - see the last line here:

     (setq org-node-filter-fn
           (lambda (node)
             (not (or (org-node-get-todo node) ;; Ignore headings with todo state
                      (member "drill" (org-node-get-tags node)) ;; Ignore :drill:
                      (assoc "ROAM_EXCLUDE" (org-node-get-properties node))
                      (string-search "archive" (org-node-get-file-path node))))))

5.9 Limitation: Org-ref
=======================

Org-node supports the Org 9.5 @citations, but not fully the aftermarket
org-ref (https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref) &citations that emulate
LaTeX look-and-feel, since it nearly doubles my scan time if I amend
‘org-link-plain-re’ to match all of ‘org-ref-cite-types’.

   What works is bracketed Org-ref v3 citations that start with "cite"
or "Cite", e.g.  ‘[[citep:...]]’, ‘[[Citealt:...]]’,
‘[[citeauthor:...]]’, since org-node-parser.el is able to pick them up
for free.  What's doesn't work is e.g.  ‘[[parencite:...]]’ since it
doesn't start with "cite", and plain ‘citep:...’ since it is not wrapped
in brackets.

5.10 Tip: On very slow filesystems
==================================

I hear that on Termux on Android, filesystem access can be so slow that
it's a pain to cycle dailies with org-roam (11 seconds just to goto next
daily
(https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node/issues/24#issuecomment-2278605819)!).
A Redditor also said Apple NFS is not ideal for Emacs.

   Good news.  You can speed up some functions by making them look up
org-node tables and avoid the filesystem:

     (advice-add #'org-roam-list-files :override
                 #'org-node-fakeroam-list-files)

     (advice-add #'org-roam-dailies--list-files :override
                 #'org-node-fakeroam-list-dailies)

     (advice-add #'org-roam-dailies--daily-note-p :override
                 #'org-node-fakeroam-daily-note-p)

5.11 Tip: Word-wrap in the Roam buffer?
=======================================

This has nothing to do with org-node, but I actually didn't know this
for ages.

   If you don't hard-wrap but prefer visual-line-mode or similar
(org-roam#1862 (https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/issues/1862)), you
have to enable such modes yourself - it sensibly doesn't inherit your
Org hooks:

     (add-hook 'org-roam-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)


File: org-node.info,  Node: Toolbox,  Prev: Tip Word-wrap in the Roam buffer?,  Up: Misc

5.12 Toolbox
============

Basic commands:

   • ‘org-node-find’
   • ‘org-node-insert-link’
   • ‘org-node-insert-transclusion’
   • ‘org-node-insert-transclusion-as-subtree’
   • ‘org-node-visit-random’
   • ‘org-node-series-dispatch’
        • Browse node series - see README
   • ‘org-node-extract-subtree’
        • A bizarro counterpart to ‘org-roam-extract-subtree’.  Export
          the subtree at point into a file-level node, *leave a link
          where the subtree was*, and show the new file as current
          buffer.
   • ‘org-node-nodeify-entry’
        • (Trivial) Give an ID to the subtree at point, and run the hook
          ‘org-node-creation-hook’
   • ‘org-node-insert-heading’
        • (Trivial) Shortcut for ‘org-insert-heading’ +
          ‘org-node-nodeify-entry’
   • ‘org-node-grep’
        • (Requires consult (https://github.com/minad/consult)) Grep
          across all known Org files.
             • Very useful combined with embark
               (https://github.com/oantolin/embark)-export & wgrep
               (https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep), to
               search-and-replace a given string everywhere in every
               directory, for example to rename a tag once and for all.
             • This will use ripgrep if installed, otherwise it is very
               slow.
   • ‘org-node-fakeroam-show-roam-buffer’
        • A different way to invoke the Roam buffer: display the buffer
          _or_ refresh it if it was already visible.  And a plot twist,
          if it was not visible, do not refresh until the second
          invocation.
             • Useful if you have disabled the automatic redisplay,
               because the Roam command ‘org-roam-buffer-toggle’ is not
               meant for that.

   Rarer commands:

   • ‘org-node-lint-all-files’
        • Can help you fix a broken setup: it runs org-lint on all known
          files and generates a report of syntax problems, for you to
          correct at will.  Org-node assumes all files have valid syntax
          (https://github.com/meedstrom/org-node/issues/8#issuecomment-2101316447),
          though many of the problems reported by org-lint are
          survivable.
   • ‘org-node-list-dead-links’
        • List links where the destination ID could not be found
   • ‘org-node-list-reflinks’
        • List citations and non-ID links
   • ‘org-node-rewrite-links-ask’
        • Look for link descriptions that got out of sync with the
          corresponding node title, then prompt at each link to update
          it
   • ‘org-node-rename-file-by-title’
        • Auto-rename the file based on the current ‘#+title’
             • Works as an after-save-hook!  Does nothing until you
               configure ‘org-node-renames-allowed-dirs’.
   • ‘org-node-backlink-fix-all’
        • Update ‘BACKLINKS’ property in all nodes
   • ‘org-node-list-feedback-arcs’
        • (Requires GNU R) Explore feedback arcs
          (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_arc_set) in your ID
          link network.  Can be a nice occasional QA routine
          (https://edstrom.dev/zvjjm/slipbox-workflow#ttqyc).
   • ‘org-node-rename-asset-and-rewrite-links’
        • Interactively rename an asset such as an image file and try to
          update all Org links to them.  Requires wgrep
          (https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep).
             • NOTE: For now, it only looks for links inside the root
               directory that it prompts you for, and sub and
               sub-subdirectories and so on - but won't find a link
               outside that root directory.

               Like if you have Org files under /mnt linking to assets
               in /home, those links won't be updated.  Neither if you
               choose ~/org/subdir as the root directory will links in
               ~/org/file.org be updated.
